# GMLinear 2

Matrix and vector library for GameMaker 2

## Introduction

GMLinear is an implementation of matrix and vector operations in pure GML. You can use it to simplify many common calculations in 2D and 3D geometry and implement algorithms/formulas involving linear algebra. Hard-coded optimized functions are available for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

## Requirements

- GameMaker 2022 LTS or above

If you use GameMaker Studio 2.3.0 to 2.3.7, please use v2.3.0.

If you use GameMaker Studio 2.2 or below, please use v2.0.0.

If you use GameMaker Studio 1.4, please see [GMLinear Legacy](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear-legacy).

## Installation

Download the latest version from [the YoYo Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8170/gmlinear) or [the Releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2/releases).

## Contributing to GMLinear

- Clone this repository.
- Open the project in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the `GMLinear` extension. Also add corresponding tests to the `GMLinear_test` script group.
- Use F5 to run the test suite. A successful run should exit on its own without showing any errors (native platforms) or show a green background (HTML5-based platforms).
- Open a pull request [here](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2/issues).
