# GMLinear v2.3.0

Matrix and vector library for GameMaker Studio 2.3.3+

## Introduction

GMLinear is an implementation of matrix and vector operations in pure GML. You can use it to simplify many common calculations in 2D and 3D geometry and implement algorithms/formulas involving linear algebra. Hard-coded optimized functions are available for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 2.3.3 or above

If you use GameMaker Studio 2.2 or below, please use v2.0.0.

If you use GameMaker Studio 1.4, please see [GMLinear Legacy](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear-legacy).

## Installation

Download the latest version from [the YoYo Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/8170/gmlinear) or [the Releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2/releases).

## Contributing to GMLinear

- Clone this repository.
- Open the project in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the `GMLinear` extension. Also add corresponding tests to the `GMLinear_test` script group.
- Use F5 to run the test suite. A successful run should exit on its own without showing any errors (native platforms) or show a green background (HTML5-based platforms).
- Open a pull request [here](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2/issues).
